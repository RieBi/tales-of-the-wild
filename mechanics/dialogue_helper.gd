	Once a man was hunting in a forest, and from a thin air the Capybara appeared. And in a spare second, animals started appearing out of nowhere.
	The Capybara's eyes were giving away fulgent light, so intense, that the man almost blinded himself when he looked at the Capybara.

	No other pigs. Noone can stop me from eating. It was such a good idea to start screaming after they sent me to get more food.
	Those pigs are as stupid as a lumber log. They think that something dangerous haunts these crypts. They've all gone mad with the Pig Brother.",

	Ah, if only I had a way to become young again.",
	"follower_sergio_4": "Wait, you know what? You would always hear the peasants tell bloody stories of Sacred Capybara, but those are no more than lies.
	It is well known that Sacred Capybard was once a member of Guardian Order, before it was disbanded. My grandpa told it to me.
	Or was it grandgrandpa? Ah, I bet he was older at the time than I am now. So, where did I stop?",
	"follower_sergio_5": "Oh, yeah. Guardian Order was disbanded and the five higher members of it parted their ways.
	Since then, every human must pray to The Three Guardian at least once a day. Otherwise, a great evil awaits those who dare not to.
	We owe everything to The Three Guardians. If not them, the world would a place for no men to live.",
	"follower_isolde_1": "You see those flowerbeds? I've been learning to grow them since I was a child.
	The blue ones, on the right, are the most difficult to grow. A legend says these flowers were once pure black, and staring at them for a few seconds would sink your sould into void.
	But after you, Capybara, fought the Black Mermaid, and launched its hideous tail into oblivion, a curse was lifted,
	and the flowers turned into charming blue color, as they are now. Is the story true? Did you really fight Black Mermaid?",
	"follower_isolde_2": "Pardon me if I'm too insistive, it's a great honor for me to meet you. By the way, the blue flowers
	are called marmaids. Yes, marmaids, and not mermaids, like most people tend to think. They even have magic properties.
	If you carry these flowers onto the peak of a mountain during full moon at the eighth month of year on second day of week
	during a rainy day after the mist had fallen and birds went to sleep and a hawk catches a mouse right at the edge of an ocean
	after a shark eats two teaspoons of salt covered in a weak mold only then to fold its tail and sing a song of seven heirs,
	and sky turns red after a king dies due to being stabbed by bayonet, and a chalice of blood is drinked by a rat,
	and a snake bites me after I play clarinet...",
	"follower_isolde_3": "Oops, did I say snake? I meant to say python. Not Monty Python, but just a regular python. You know, they are very different.
	So, when all of that happens and you bring marmaids to the peak of a mountain, nothing abnormal happens. Can you imagine that?
	It's so intruiging! I wish I had a chance to try it one day. Till then, I wouldn't be able to consider myself a gigachad.",
	# CUTSCENE bullshittery
	"follower_olaf_1": "Hey ya, pokemon! Oh, you are not a pokemon, you are Sacred Capybara, the one we've been waiting for during all these years?
	That's for the better. Have you already talked with Sergio? The old man's sight might be gone, but his vision holds true.
	It's thanks to him that I could learn the art of Khan-Ku. Or was it Kung-Fu? Or Tsan-Mu? I can't ever remember that name.
	Yet, it doesn't prevent me from practicing it. I've learnt a lot of stuff already, but there's still much more to learn.

	But right now, I am here. Growing in front of you, stopping you from moving farther before you meet all of us and talk with Asedine.",
	"follower_bondurnar_4": "You know what? I don't believe any of the nonsense that Asedine is preaching. If there's anything special in this world, it ain't you.
	You look like a typical capybara.",

	# turns red
	"follower_bondurnar_7": "You see? I'm still as green as you are. Nothing special about ya. Not a tad bit.
	If you wonder why I joined the followers of sacred capybara, it's because Olaf has quite a lot of poop hidden in his camp, believe it or not.
	Did I say poop? NOPE! It's a golden quality fertilizer. That's what makes by berries taste so sweet. Wanna try one?
	Anyway, I'm not moving till Asedine tells me to.",

	sticky problem. You see, the ceremony needs a burning campfire. Such are the rules. It was not me who wrote them.
	WELL, techincally it was me <3. Yet, we will omit that in the current situation. You shall find 5 good sticks that will burn well.
	We've got a nice looking forest around the camp, I'm pretty sure there are lots of sticks lying on the ground in it.
