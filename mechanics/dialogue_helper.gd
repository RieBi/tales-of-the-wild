	In a distant kingdom, over the ocean, far away, lives Sacred Capybara. The Capybara's ways are but unknown, and yet there are people who struck upon it.
	Once a man was hunting in a forest, and from a thin air the Capybara appeared. And in a spare second, animals started appearing out of nowhere.
	The Capybara's eyes were giving away fulgent light, so intense, that the man almost blinded himself when he looked at the Capybara.
	The man fell onto his knees and started begging for forgiveness. Then, the Capybara started growing bigger and bigger.
	After a minute, it was as big as a mountain. Then, it disappeared.",

	"lucas_2": "My parents always say that I shouldn't stay outside so late. I hope they won't find me here.
	I love to go and explore the forest to the north of here. Recently, I found a weird structure, it looks almost like a temple.
	I've tried to go further, but I couldn't find a way to do it. It seems like there's some sort of a puzzle.
	Come on, help me with it :D",

	"pig_1_1": "Greetings, unpig! We haven't seen unanimalists here since we expelled humans from here.

	"pig_1_truth": "With the food shortage gone, we decided to expand our territories. Soon the whole world would be under our control!
	Master is watching you.",

	You go help. Who is you? Go talk with master pig. He needs you help. I enjoy doubleplusgood life here...",

	I guess we will have to stick with the old version for now.",
	"pig_4_2": "By the way, do you think unold should be the opposite of old, or unyoung be the opposite of young? Ah, nevermind, I'll figure that out once we get food.",
	"pig_4_truth": "Thanks to brave actions of Master, we now have doubleplusplenty of food. The new pigspeak dictionary is almost done!
	Master is watching you.",
	"pig_5_1": "Ahoy, unpig! I'm guarding the door. Since our fellow comrade pig disappeared in the crypt, we close the door.
	We are plusafraid to go there. We hear plusbad screams during undays coming from the crypt. I'll open it if master says so.",
	"pig_5_2": "Please, go talk to master! I miss blueberries so much! I haven't eaten one for days now. My stomach hurts.
	Noone else wanted to eat them, so I was doing it all day long.",
	"pig_5_3": "Finally! I've opened the door. Go and kill what lurks there, whatever it might cost you!",
	"pig_5_truth": "Since Master eradicated all evil in the crypt, I've been administered to serve in the Pignistry of food.
	Now, I deprive the pigs who commit thought crime of food. Everyone is living even goodlier now.
	Master is watching you.",
	"pig_6_1": "How's you doing, comrade unpig? Did you know that we've grown 718 bananas today, which is 20 times more than we did untomorrow,
	and twice as much as was planned? We live goodlier and goodlier every day. I'm so happy to serve the master.",
	"pig_6_2": "I may not be fed, but it's just because all other pig comrades need bananas more than me.
	I am willing to be hungry so that others can live doubleplusgood life. Long live the master!",
	"pig_6_truth": "Long live Master, comrade unpig! Did you know that every pig is having 1 banana per day now,
	which is a hundred times more than untomorrow, and 5 times as much as was planned?
	Master is watching you.",
	"pig_7_1": "I guard the master. I have always guarded the master. He has always been the master.
	Since the old guard pig refs unperson, I have always guarded the master. Forever. I will do so.
	I am the only one who ever guarded the master. It's hard to guard when you unfed. I have never been hungry.
	I have always been fed. I am not hungry. Never been so.",
	"pig_7_2": "Long live the master!",
	"pig_8_1": "What are you? A rug? You is big for a rug. Anyway, I am the master, and you obey me. You have always obeyed me.
	The only thing you have done in your life is obeyed me. Now, go into the crypt and eradicate all evil. You may as well tell the guard to open the door.",
	"pig_8_2": "You. Have. Always. Obeyed. Me. And will do so. Forever.",
	"pig_8_3": "Long live me!",
	"pig_8_truth": "I am watching you. I have always watched you. I will always do. You will obey me. You have always obeyed me.
	You will always do. Here's a red key for obedience.",
	"pig_big_1": "Who are you? How did you get here? It's so good just to lie here and eat all the food. Just me. No master.
	No other pigs. Noone can stop me from eating. It was such a good idea to start screaming after they sent me to get more food.
	Those pigs are as stupid as a lumber log. They think that something dangerous haunts these crypts. They've all gone mad with the master.",
	"pig_big_2": "So it's the master who sent you here? You know what? Go and tell him that you found my dead body and all the food disappeared.
	Say that there's blood everywhere around here and god knows what can be lurking here. That way, I can enjoy eating all the food forever ;)"
